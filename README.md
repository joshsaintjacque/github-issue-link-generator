# GitHub Issue Link Generator

## What is it?

Sometimes you need a lightweight way to prefill a GitHub issue. I found myself
in that position recently and wanted a quick-and-dirty way to generate an issue
link with certain fields already filled out. I couldn't find one.

I turned to the docs and realized that I needed a body with various pieces of
formatting (like whitespace) and writing that into the URL parameter was hard.

I'm pretty lazy, so I did the only rational thing: I spent a few hours creating
this tool so that I could save a few minutes just writing the URL by hand. 🔥🔥🔥
